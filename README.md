# Using Gradle and Docker to build apps with Liberty

This is a simple application to show setting up an application that uses JAX-RS and runs on LIberty. The application uses Gradle to build and can be deployed in a Docker container.

## Deploying to Bluemix

You can also deploy this aplication to Bluemix using Bluemix's IBM Container Service.

**Please note** that before you deploy, you need to have created a Container Namespace in Bluemix. This can only be set once and so should be done manually before you run this sample. To do this login to bluemix at (https://console.ng.bluemix.net/) and select `Compute`. During te wizard you will be asked to provide a namespace. Once this has been completed, you can come back here and use the Deploy to Bluemix button.
